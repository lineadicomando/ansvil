# Ansvil

Ansvil is a lightweight and modular Docker container based on **AlmaLinux**, designed to provide a complete, stable, and portable environment for **Ansible** automation.  
It includes:

- **Ansible**
- **Code-Server** (VS Code via browser)
- **Semaphore UI** (web interface for orchestrating Ansible tasks)

Whether you're writing playbooks, orchestrating tasks, or just trying to survive YAML indentation, **Ansvil is your safe space for automation**.

---

## Project contents

- **AlmaLinux 9.x** â€“ a RHEL-compatible, stable and secure base  
- **Ansible** â€“ the core automation engine  
- **Code-Server** â€“ browser-accessible Visual Studio Code  
- **Semaphore UI** â€“ frontend to manage Ansible tasks  

---

## Deployment considerations

Ansvil uses `network_mode: host` to ensure that **Ansible** can interact directly with the host's network, simplifying communication with local devices.

### Warning

- **Dedicated host recommended** â€“ Avoid conflicts with other services listening on the same ports.  
- **Firewall is a must** â€“ Expose only strictly necessary ports.  
- **Time sync (NTP)** â€“ Crucial for TLS, logging, and scheduling.

---

### Ports used

| Port  | Purpose                     | Notes                                        |
|-------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `80`  | HTTP                        | Automatically redirects to HTTPS (`443`)     |
| `443` | HTTPS (reverse proxy)       | **Only port to expose for web access**       |
| `8080`| Code-Server (internal)      | Accessible only via reverse proxy            |
| `3000`| Semaphore UI (internal)     | Accessible only via reverse proxy            |
| `3306`| MariaDB (internal)          | Accessible only from containers              |

**Only expose port `443`** externally.  
All other ports are used **internally within the container** and managed by the integrated reverse proxy (Nginx-based).

---

## Quick start

### `make` method (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lineadicomando/ansvil.git
cd ansvil
make init     # creates .env file if missing
make up       # starts services in background
```

For more available commands:

```bash
make help
```

### Manual method (without `make`)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lineadicomando/ansvil.git
cd ansvil
cp .env.example .env  # configure environment variables
docker compose up -d
````

---

## Accessing the services

Once Ansvil is up and running, you can access the web interface via browser:

[https://127.0.0.1](https://127.0.0.1) or [https://localhost](https://localhost)

A **welcome page** will appear with direct links to:

* **Code-Server**
* **Semaphore UI**

### Access from other devices (LAN)

If the host is properly configured (hostname, firewall, local DNS), you can access it from your local network:

* via **local hostname** (e.g. `https://ansvil.local`)
* or via **private IP** (e.g. `https://192.168.1.42`)

In both cases, **as long as port `443` is reachable**, you're good to go.
No need to expose ports `8080` or `3000` directly.

---

### Default credentials

| Service          | User    | Password                   |
| ---------------- | ------- | -------------------------- |
| **Code-Server**  |         | `ansvil` *(password only)* |
| **Semaphore UI** | `admin` | `ansvil`                   |

You can change all initial credentials via the `.env` file.
