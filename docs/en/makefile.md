| `status` | Alias for `ps` |
| `up` | Start Docker Compose services in background |
| `down` | Stop and remove Docker Compose services |
| `start` | Start existing Docker Compose containers |
| `stop` | Stop running containers without removing them |
| `restart` | Restart Docker Compose services (full rebuild) |
| `restart-soft` | Restart services without recreating containers |
| `logs` | Show logs from all services |
| `logs-<service>` | Show logs from a specific service |
| `pull` | Pull latest Docker images |
| `update` | Pull and restart all services |
| `init` | Initialize `.env` from `.env.example` |
